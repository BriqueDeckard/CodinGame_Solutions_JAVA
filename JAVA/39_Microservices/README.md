# Notes on microservices

## Problematic

1. Availability : available all the time
2. Scalability : able to span more resources and to evolve
3. Updatability : the company must be able to evolve its application frequently

## Principle

The microservice architecture proposes to divide an application into small services, called "microservices", fully self-contained services that expose a REST API that other microservices can consume.
