# Service Discovery Server

Service Discovery Server applies the service discovery mechanism to allow microservices to communicate with each other. Each microservices will register with the Service Discovery Server such that it can be discovered by other microservices.

Service Discovery Server provides the Service Discovery mechanism to our application. Importing the Eureka Server dependency enables this functionality.
